=== Technically speaking...

  * LoRa uses sub-gigahertz radio frequency bands
  * Data rate 0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s depending on spreading factor
  * LoRa is the physical layer, LORAWAN is MAC Layer
  * LORAWAN acts mainly as a network layer protocol for managing communication
    between LPWAN gateways and end-node device
